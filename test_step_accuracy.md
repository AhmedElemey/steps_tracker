# Step Detection Accuracy Test

## How to Test Step Counting Accuracy

### 1. **Initial Setup**
- Open the app and sign in anonymously
- Create a profile (name and weight only)
- The app will automatically start step detection

### 2. **Calibration Process**
- The app will automatically calibrate for 15 seconds
- During calibration, hold the device still for the first 5 seconds
- Then walk normally for the remaining 10 seconds
- The app will analyze your walking pattern and set personalized thresholds

### 3. **Testing Steps**
1. **Stand Still Test**: Hold the device still for 30 seconds
   - Expected: 0 steps counted
   - This tests false positive prevention

2. **Walking Test**: Walk 20 steps in a straight line
   - Expected: ~20 steps counted (±2 steps acceptable)
   - This tests basic accuracy

3. **Different Walking Speeds**:
   - Slow walk: 10 steps
   - Normal walk: 10 steps  
   - Fast walk: 10 steps
   - Expected: ~30 total steps

4. **Device Orientation Test**: Walk while holding device in different positions
   - In hand
   - In pocket
   - In bag
   - Expected: Steps still counted accurately

### 4. **What to Look For**

#### ✅ **Good Signs:**
- Steps only counted during actual walking
- No steps counted when standing still
- Reasonable accuracy (±10% of actual steps)
- Walking state shows "Walking detected" during movement
- Calibration completes successfully

#### ❌ **Issues to Report:**
- Steps counted while standing still
- Missing steps during normal walking
- Walking state stuck in "Calibrating" or "Inconsistent"
- App crashes during step detection

### 5. **Debug Information**
The app logs detailed information to help diagnose issues:
- `Starting advanced step detection...`
- `Calibration data collected: X samples`
- `Calculated baseline magnitude: X.XX`
- `Valid step detected: peak=X.XX, valley=X.XX, diff=X.XX`
- `Step recorded! Total steps: X, Consecutive: X`

### 6. **Recalibration**
If accuracy is poor, you can recalibrate:
- The app will automatically recalibrate if needed
- Or restart the app to trigger a new calibration

## Expected Improvements

### **Before (Issues Fixed):**
- ❌ Fixed peak detection buffer indexing bug
- ❌ Too restrictive thresholds
- ❌ Poor movement validation
- ❌ Inconsistent calibration

### **After (Improvements Made):**
- ✅ Robust peak/valley detection with proper buffer handling
- ✅ Dynamic thresholds based on user's baseline
- ✅ Better movement validation using user-specific ranges
- ✅ Improved calibration with statistical analysis
- ✅ Enhanced walking pattern recognition
- ✅ More realistic step timing constraints
- ✅ Better false positive prevention

## Technical Details

### **Key Algorithm Improvements:**
1. **Peak Detection**: Fixed buffer indexing and added baseline-based thresholds
2. **Movement Validation**: Uses user's calibrated baseline instead of fixed gravity
3. **Step Validation**: Dynamic magnitude difference thresholds
4. **Walking Pattern**: Enhanced pattern recognition with peak/valley counting
5. **Calibration**: Statistical analysis with standard deviation-based thresholds

### **Configuration Updates:**
- More realistic step timing (300-1500ms between steps)
- Lower consecutive step threshold (2 instead of 3)
- More lenient magnitude ranges (8.5-18.0)
- Higher default sensitivity (0.6 instead of 0.5)
